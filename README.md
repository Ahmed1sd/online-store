My Big E-Commerce Front-End Project

Hi! This is a big front-end e-commerce website that I built using everything I know: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, and React.js.

I wanted to create something similar to big online stores like Amazon or Noon — so I designed a full shopping experience from scratch, including product pages, cart system, and even an admin panel (UI only).

 What’s Inside?

- Responsive design for all devices
- Home page with categories and products
- Real images with random prices and discounts
- Product details page (with reviews, specs, etc.)
- Working cart interface (add, remove, total price)
- Checkout page design (just front-end)
- Login & register pages (UI only)
- Admin Dashboard (built with React)
- Light and dark mode toggle
- Arabic and English UI support
